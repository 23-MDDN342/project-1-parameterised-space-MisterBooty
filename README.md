### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

02/03 Came up with a idea for my parameterisedSpace project. It consists of a wallpaper of cubes, which has waves flowing through it. These waves are represented by certain faces of a row of cubes extending and then retreating like a 3d bar graph. These waves will be skipping rows in order for them to bee seen more easily. once a wave has passed, there will be a point in which all cubes are netural sizez, before extending again. However, with each extension and retreat the cubes will then change what face they extend on, giving the wave a more 3d effect.
