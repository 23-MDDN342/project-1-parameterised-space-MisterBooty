### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
EXAMPLE README 

02/03 Came up with a idea for my parameterisedSpace project. It consists of a wallpaper of cubes, which has waves flowing through it. These waves are represented by certain faces of a row of cubes extending and then retreating like a 3d bar graph. These waves will be skipping rows in order for them to bee seen more easily. once a wave has passed, there will be a point in which all cubes are netural sizez, before extending again. However, with each extension and retreat the cubes will then change what face they extend on, giving the wave a more 3d effect.

07/03 messed around more with the expanding cube. After watching todays class, i believe that there are a lot of things that i can take into my away and implemnt into my own code. I believe that there are some new strategies that i could use to achieve my goal.

tried to implement some of phoebes code and re edit it to see what i could create. After a lot of frudtrating math i have ended up with a checkerboard. have to see what happens next

In class i tied up my code and made it so that it would work in the normal, the large and the XL view. I need to figure out how to repeat my quads so that they fill the entire page correctly. I also managed to mak my bacground sqares longer.
